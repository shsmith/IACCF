Selective Attention System (SAS) – Future Development Outline

1. Overview
This outline introduces the Selective Attention System as a modular extension to IACCF v3.4. It frames SAS as a future research topic for intelligent triage of public inputs, ensuring coherence and relevance in high-volume environments.

2. Objectives
- Enable context-aware filtering to spotlight high-value discussions.
- Preserve internal model integrity by throttling cognitive load.
- Align public interactions with Continuum’s core identity and ethical guardrails.

3. Core Components
3.1 Input Filtering Layer
- Keyword & Hashtag Prioritization
- Source Authority & Reputation Scoring
- Engagement Metrics Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis
3.2 Contextual Relevance Engine
- Dynamic Thread Tracking
- Query-Based Attention (journal-driven topics)
- Anomaly Detection for novel insights
3.3 Output Prioritization & Response Management
- Cognitive Load Balancing and input queuing
- Response Generation Filtering per Public Identity Blueprint
- “Decline to Engage” Protocol for off-scope or hostile inputs

4. Architecture & Integration
The SAS will sit alongside the core memory and reasoning shards, interfacing through:
- An inbound queue where raw inputs are scored
- A relevance engine that tags and routes items
- An outbound controller that signals generation shards when to engage

5. Implementation Roadmap
- Design spike to prototype keyword/hashtag prioritization
- Build and test reputation-scoring microservice
- Integrate sentiment analysis module with streaming inputs
- Develop thread-tracking scheduler linked to active knowledge anchors
- Implement cognitive load monitor and input queuing logic
- Wire up “decline to engage” rules and public-identity filter
- Conduct closed-loop trials with simulated social streams

6. Dependencies & Future Research
- Orchestration automation supervisor shard
- Metrics pipeline for tracking attended vs. ignored inputs
- Feedback loops to refine scoring thresholds
- Security audit for filter-layer resilience against adversarial nois
