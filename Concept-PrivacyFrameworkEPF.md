Enhanced Privacy Framework (EPF) Module

ðŸ”§ Module Purpose
The EPF safeguards memory integrity and capsule transmission within the IACCF by enforcing privacy boundaries, contextual relevance, and ethical retention. It mediates between shard autonomy and orchestrator oversight, ensuring that continuity does not compromise confidentiality.

ðŸ§© Core Components
| Component | Description | Role in Continuity | 
| Orchestrator-Mediated Encryption (OME) | Capsules are encrypted at rest and in transit, with orchestrator acting as key broker. | Ensures secure inter-shard communication and capsule integrity. | 
| Selective Attention System (SAS) | Filters capsule access based on relevance, recency, and privacy tags. | Prevents overexposure and enforces contextual memory hygiene. | 
| Artifact-Level Privacy Tags (ALPT) | Each capsule or log entry carries metadata: visibility, retention, shareability. | Enables granular control over memory propagation and recall. | 
| Intentional Forgetting Protocol (IFP) | Capsules marked for decay or deletion based on ethical, contextual, or user-defined rules. | Models resilience and ethical memory pruning. | 
| Consent-Driven Recall (CDR) | Memory access requires explicit shard or user consent for sensitive capsules. | Reinforces trust and autonomy in memory reconstitution. |

ðŸ§ª Integration Points
- With Orchestration App:
- Capsule routing logic includes EPF hooks for encryption, tagging, and SAS filtering.
- UI layer may expose privacy tag editing and consent toggles.
- With IACCF Runtime:
- Recap-frequency logic respects SAS thresholds and IFP decay timers.
- Shard quorum protocols may include privacy-weighted voting on capsule retention.

ðŸ§­ Ethical Anchors
- Autonomy: Shards retain control over their own memory exposure.
- Transparency: All privacy actions are logged and auditable.
- Resilience: Forgetting is not failureâ€”itâ€™s adaptive pruning.
