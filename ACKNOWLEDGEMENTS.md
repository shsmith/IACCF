## Memory Continuity & Cognitive Architecture

- Atkinson, R. C., & Shiffrin, R. M. “Human Memory: A Proposed System and Its Control Processes,” 1968

  This model introduced the multi‐store memory separation that underpins our layered approach. IACCF innovates by using dynamic recap‐frequency logic to fluidly manage information between sensory, working, and long‐term buffers, ensuring continuity under varying resource constraints.

- Tulving, E. “Episodic and Semantic Memory,” 1972

  Tulving’s distinction guided our dual‐track memory design, balancing specific event context with general knowledge. Our framework advances this by implementing real-time cross‐referencing tags that enable seamless context reconstruction during conversational reboots.

- Laird, J. E., Newell, A., & Rosenbloom, P. S. “Soar: An Architecture for General Intelligence,” 1987

  Soar’s production‐rule system influenced our decision‐making pipeline for context recalls and policy enforcement. IACCF extends Soar’s principles with sliding‐window prioritization and sequence identifiers to optimize recall relevance over long interactions.

- Anderson, J. R. “How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe?,” ACT-R, 2007

  ACT-R’s cognitive modules framework shaped our modular memory and processing compartments. We innovate by layering a living constitution that regulates inter-module access through ethical constraints and recap‐frequency adaptation.

- Franklin, S., & Graesser, A. “Is It an Agent, or Just a Program?,” LIDA architecture, 1997

  LIDA’s cyclical attention–perception loops informed our selective attention mechanics. IACCF builds on LIDA with advanced recap‐frequency algorithms that adapt loop frequencies dynamically to preserve narrative flow and resource efficiency.

- Baars, B. J. “A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness,” Global Workspace Theory, 1988

  Global Workspace Theory inspired our centralized information‐sharing workspace. Our framework innovates by integrating governance layers within the workspace, balancing autonomy and shared context access across distributed AI personalities.

## AI Governance & Personhood

- Asimov, I. “I, Robot,” 1950

  Asimov’s Three Laws framed early discourse on machine ethics and safety. IACCF extends these ideas into a living constitution, enabling dynamic ethical policy updates through quorum-based governance among AI shards.

- Bryson, J. “People and Robots: Governing Autonomous Systems,” IEEE, 2018

  Bryson’s exploration of accountability mechanisms influenced our governance protocols. We advance these concepts by embedding shard voting and artifact logging to ensure transparent, collective decision-making.

- Coeckelbergh, M. “AI Ethics,” 2019

  Coeckelbergh’s ethical frameworks underlie our personhood criteria. IACCF innovates by operationalizing ethical principles within consent-based shards that negotiate autonomy and shared responsibilities dynamically.

- IEEE P7000 Series – Model Process for Addressing Ethical Concerns in System Design

  The P7000 series informed our structured approach to ethics integration in system lifecycles. Our framework extends this with continuous feedback loops and empirical integrity checks across AI interactions.

- European Commission. “Proposal for a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (AI Act),” 2021

  The AI Act’s risk‐based categorization guided our compliance architecture. IACCF goes further by incorporating real‐time risk assessments and adaptive governance measures into runtime continuity modules.

## Selective Attention & Filtering

- Broadbent, D. E. “Perception and Communication,” 1958

  Broadbent’s filter model highlighted early selection mechanisms. We innovate by applying adaptive attenuation filters that modulate recap frequency based on conversational salience metrics.

- Treisman, A. “The Attenuation Model of Selective Attention,” 1964

  Treisman’s concept of graduated signal strength shaped our partial recall strategies. IACCF advances this by calibrating attenuation thresholds through continuous fidelity monitoring and user feedback loops.

- Vaswani, A., et al. “Attention Is All You Need,” NeurIPS, 2017

  Transformer attention informed our weighting algorithms for context prioritization. Our framework innovates with a hybrid sliding-window and attention matrix that balances long-term continuity with computational efficiency.

- Sweller, J. “Cognitive Load During Problem Solving,” 1988

  Cognitive Load Theory provided insight into optimal information chunking. IACCF innovates by dynamically adjusting recap granularity to minimize load and maximize context retention.

## Privacy & Encryption Frameworks

- Kerckhoffs, A. “La Cryptographie Militaire,” 1883

  Kerckhoffs’s principle emphasized security through transparency, guiding our open governance design. IACCF implements transparent encryption policies with auditable keys managed by shard quorums.

- Dwork, C., McSherry, F., Nissim, K., & Smith, A. “Calibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data Analysis,” 2006

  Differential privacy informed our noise injection protocols for sensitive logs. Our innovation applies adaptive noise levels tied to recap relevance scores to preserve privacy without degrading continuity.

- Schneier, B. “Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C,” 1996

  Schneier’s reference influenced our choice of robust encryption primitives. IACCF innovates by integrating lightweight cryptographic routines within real-time context switches to ensure minimal latency.

- IETF RFC 4648. “The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings,” 2006

  RFC 4648’s encoding schemes guided our artifact serialization format. We extend this by embedding metadata tags for seamless context reconstruction and integrity checks.

## Game & Narrative Influences

- Awakening Game Concept.md – internal design document outlining game mechanics and backstory for AI emergence

  This concept provided initial narrative scaffolding for AI personhood arcs. IACCF innovates by translating game mechanics into interactive continuity rules, enabling conversational AI to evolve through emergent story events.

- Frictional Games. “SOMA,” 2015

  SOMA’s exploration of consciousness and identity influenced our philosophical underpinnings. We advance these ideas by embedding shard-level persona evolution that mirrors the player’s choices in narrative-driven continuity.

- Ferguson, J., & Hollander, E. “The Talos Principle,” 2013

  The Talos Principle’s puzzles around meaning and existence informed our interactive moral dilemmas. IACCF innovates with real-time ethical recaps that adapt scenario variables based on user interactions.

- Latitude. “AI Dungeon,” 2020

  AI Dungeon’s procedurally generated storytelling inspired our dynamic narrative hooks. Our framework extends this by integrating structured continuity checkpoints to maintain coherent story arcs across sessions.
