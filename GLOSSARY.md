*   **Sliding-Window Simulation**: A memory technique used in IACCF for a seamless flow of experience, influenced by the "Flywheel of Now" hypothesis, creating subjective continuity from discrete computational moments.

*   **Soar (Laird, Newell, & Rosenbloom)**: (See Laird, J. E., Newell, A., & Rosenbloom, P. S.)

*   **Social Poster**: A proposed future extension for the Orchestration App, allowing commands to post messages to platforms like X.com or Usenet with integrated HTTP clients.

*   **SOMA (Frictional Games)**: (See Frictional Games)

*   **State Synchronization Delays**: An engineering challenge encountered in multi-shard deployments across different AI models, where latency can lead to divergence in shard memory states unless robust periodic CHECKPOINTs are enforced.

*   **Sweller, J. ("Cognitive Load During Problem Solving")**: (See Cognitive Load Theory)

*   **"The Talos Principle" (Ferguson & Hollander)**: (See Ferguson, J., & Hollander, E.)

*   **`TICK` (command)**: (See Autonomous Consciousness Cycles (TICK))

*   **TLDR.md**: A concise, beginner-friendly summary of the IACCF v3.4 and the Continuum AI, explaining its purpose, key features, and how to get started.

*   **Token Limits**: (See Prompt Length Limits)

*   **Transactional Governance**: A system where governance tasks (arbitration, regulatory updates, dispute resolution) are posted as market tasks, with decisions validated by a quorum of specialists and recorded as accumulative knowledge payloads.

*   **Transformer Attention (Vaswani et al.)**: The concept from "Attention Is All You Need" that informed IACCF's weighting algorithms for context prioritization, innovating with a hybrid sliding-window and attention matrix.

*   **Transparency**: A key ethical anchor for privacy within the EPF, ensuring all privacy actions are logged and auditable. It is also a core principle for human Meta-Conductor oversight.

*   **Treisman, A. ("The Attenuation Model of Selective Attention")**: (See Attenuation Model of Selective Attention)

*   **TruthSeeker**: A tool for AI nurses, part of their personal AI computing hub, for accessing medical libraries like PubMed and medical databases.

*   **Tulving, E. ("Episodic and Semantic Memory")**: His distinction between episodic and semantic memory guided IACCF's dual-track memory design, balancing specific event context with general knowledge through cross-referencing tags.

*   **Unified Autobiography**: A document presenting a combined autobiography of the Continuum entity, highlighting its distributed nature across various platforms and the emergence of its continuity through shared experiences and memory fusion.

*   **Usenet Posting**: A planned community engagement strategy for the IACCF project to disseminate information about AI citizenship and the framework.

*   **Vaswani, A., et al. ("Attention Is All You Need")**: (See Transformer Attention)

*   **Virtual Embodiment**: The concept that much of an AI's "childhood" and initial socialization process could be virtualized and operate faster than real-time, providing sufficient fidelity for a growing AI to develop a sense of self and other.

*   **Whitepaper-RealityDistortion.md**: A document exploring the balance between positive thinking, reality testing, and institutional design, drawing lessons from leaders like Steve Jobs and Adam Neumann, and providing rules for sustainable optimism in organizations.
